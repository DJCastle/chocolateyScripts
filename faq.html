            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Chocolatey is a free, open-source package manager for Windows. It works like <code>apt</code> on Linux or Homebrew on macOS, letting you install, update, and manage software from the command line. Instead of downloading installers from the web and clicking through setup wizards, you run a single command like <code>choco install googlechrome</code> and Chocolatey handles the rest.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes, Chocolatey is widely trusted in the Windows ecosystem and is used by individual developers, IT teams, and enterprises around the world. Packages in the <a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chocolatey Community Repository</a> go through a moderation process that includes automated checks and human review.</p>
              <p>As with any package manager, you should always review what you install and prefer packages from trusted maintainers with high download counts.</p>

            <summary class="faq-question">What is the difference between <code>choco install</code> and <code>choco upgrade</code>?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p><code>choco install</code> is used to install a package for the first time. <code>choco upgrade</code> updates an already-installed package to the latest version. You can also run <code>choco upgrade all</code> to update every installed package at once, which is exactly what the auto-update script automates.</p>
              <p>If you run <code>choco install</code> on a package that is already installed, Chocolatey will tell you the package is already present and take no action.</p>

              <p>Chocolatey itself supports Windows 7 and later, but these scripts are designed for and tested on <strong>Windows 10</strong> and <strong>Windows 11</strong>. You need PowerShell 5.1 or later (included with Windows 10/11) and administrator privileges to run the scripts.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The scripts are fully open-source and every line of code is available for review on <a href="https://github.com/DJCastle/chocolateyScripts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. They include safety features like confirmation prompts, dry-run modes, and detailed logging.</p>
              <p>That said, they do modify system settings (execution policies, scheduled tasks, installed software), so you should always read through a script before running it with administrator privileges.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. All scripts are tested on both Windows 10 and Windows 11. Features like toast notifications use the Windows notification system that is available on both operating systems. The scheduled tasks functionality also works identically on both versions.</p>

              <p>Common causes include network issues, insufficient disk space, or the package being temporarily unavailable from the repository.
